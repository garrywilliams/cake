# Cake Bakery API: The Sweetest API on the Web!

![Delicious Cake](cake.png) *Indulge in our delightful API that serves up the yummiest cakes!*

Welcome to the Cake Bakery API, a viral sensation in the world of digital bakeries! This API, crafted with love and a sprinkle of Python magic, allows you to interact with a virtual bakery's catalog of mouth-watering cakes. Whether you're looking to browse our extensive cake collection, add a new cake to our showcase, or even remove a cake from the menu, our API has got you covered.

## Features

- **Swagger/OpenAPI Spec**: Dive into our well-documented API with Swagger, making integration a piece of cake!
- **List All Cakes**: Browse our entire collection of cakes, each more tempting than the last.
- **Add a New Cake**: Got a new cake idea? Add it to our collection with ease.
- **Delete a Cake**: Too many cakes? Remove one from the list with a simple API call.
- **No Authentication Hassles**: We trust you! No need to worry about authentication tokens here.
- **Docker/Kubernetes Ready**: Deploy our API in a containerized environment with minimal setup.

## Data Model: Cake üç∞

Our API revolves around the `Cake` model, which includes:

- `id`: A unique identifier for each cake.
- `name`: The name of the cake (up to 30 characters).
- `comment`: A brief description or comment about the cake (up to 200 characters).
- `imageUrl`: A URL link to an image of the cake.
- `yumFactor`: A rating from 1 to 5 indicating how yummy the cake is.

### Example Cake JSON

```json
{
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Lemon cheesecake",
    "comment": "A cheesecake made of lemon",
    "imageUrl": "http://www.food.com/recipelemon-cheesecake-31004",
    "yumFactor": 3
}
```

## Getting Started

To get started with our Cake Bakery API:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cake-bakery-api.git`
2. Navigate into the project directory: `cd cake-bakery-api`
3. Deploy using Docker or Kubernetes as per the provided instructions.

## API Endpoints

    participant User
    participant API
    User->>API: GET /cakes/
    API->>User: List of cakes
    User->>API: POST /cakes/
    API->>User: Cake added
    User->>API: GET /cakes/{id}
    API->>User: Cake details
    User->>API: DELETE /cakes/{id}
    API->>User: Cake deleted
```

- `GET /cakes/`: Retrieve a list of all cakes.
- `GET /cakes/{id}`: Retrieve a specific cake by ID. Returns a 404 error if the cake does not exist.
- `POST /cakes/`: Add a new cake to the collection.
- `DELETE /cakes/{id}`: Remove a cake from the collection.

## Deployment

This API is container-ready! You can deploy it using either Docker or Kubernetes.

# Developer Guide

Welcome, developers! This section is dedicated to helping you get up and running with the Cake Bakery API, a FastAPI application. Below, you'll find detailed instructions on setting up your development environment, using the Makefile for various tasks, and deploying the application using Docker.

## FastAPI Framework

This application is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI is known for its high speed and ease of use, making it an excellent choice for building robust APIs.

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To set up your development environment, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/cake-bakery-api.git
   cd cake-bakery-api
   ```

2. **Using the Makefile**: The included Makefile has several targets to simplify common development tasks.

   - **Creating a Virtual Environment**:
     ```bash
     make setup
     ```
     This command creates a virtual environment and installs all necessary dependencies.

   - **Running Tests**:
     ```bash
     make test
     ```
     Use this command to run the test suite with pytest.

   - **Running the Application Locally**:
     ```bash
     make run
     ```
     This starts the FastAPI server locally using Uvicorn.

   - **Linting the Code**:
     ```bash
     make lint
     ```
     This command lints the codebase using tools like isort, black, and flake8.

   - **Generating Coverage Reports**:
     ```bash
     make coverage
     ```
     Use this to generate a test coverage report.

   - **Cleaning Up**:
     ```bash
     make clean
     ```
     This command cleans up the project, removing the virtual environment and other artifacts.

## Deploying with Docker

The application is Docker-ready, allowing for easy deployment. Here‚Äôs how you can use Docker to deploy the application:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t cake-bakery-api .
   ```
   This command builds a Docker image for the application, tagging it as `cake-bakery-api`.

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 cake-bakery-api
   ```
   This starts a container from the image, mapping port 8000 of the container to port 8000 on your host machine.

3. **Accessing the Application**:
   Once the container is running, you can access the API at `http://localhost:8000`.

## Additional Notes

- **FastAPI Swagger UI**: FastAPI automatically generates and serves a Swagger UI for your API. Once your server is running, you can access it at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

- **Hot Reloading**: For local development, running the application with `make run` enables hot reloading, allowing you to see changes in real-time without restarting the server.

- **Environment Variables**: Remember to set any necessary environment variables, especially when deploying in production.

We hope this guide helps you in developing and deploying the Cake Bakery API. Happy coding, and enjoy the sweet journey of building with FastAPI and Docker! üç∞‚ú®
